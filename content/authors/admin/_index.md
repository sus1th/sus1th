I am a Ph. D student in the department of mechanical engineering working under the supervision of Dr. Girish Kumar Rajan and Dr. Madan Mohan A at Indian Institute of Technology, Tirupati. Initially, I joined as an M. S student. After 1 year, I upgraded my registration to M. S+ Ph. D in Jan 2022.

I hold a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from IIITDM Kancheepuram. I come from a rural, middle class background.
